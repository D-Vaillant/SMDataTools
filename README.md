## SMDataTools
###### Stepmania Data Tools compiles the [Stepmania File Parser](https://github.com/jhaco/SMFile_Parser) and [Stepmania File Writer](https://github.com/jhaco/SMFile_Writer) scripts into one. Refer to either scripts' README for more information. Note: parser is redefined as collect.

#### Usage:

- Command: `python stepmania_data_tools.py [collect/write] -i input_directory -o output_directory`
- Input/output directories must be specified. It is recommended to create an external script with the requirements.
