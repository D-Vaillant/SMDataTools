## SMDataTools
###### Stepmania Data Tools compiles the [Stepmania File Parser](https://github.com/jhaco/SMFile_Parser) and [Stepmania File Writer](https://github.com/jhaco/SMFile_Writer) scripts into one. Refer to either scripts' README for more information.

`python stepmania_data_tools.py [collect/write] -i input_directory -o output_directory`

#### Notes: 

- Input and output directories must be specified. Recommend creating an external script with the directory requirements.
- Parser is redefined as "collect" in Stepmania Data Tools.
